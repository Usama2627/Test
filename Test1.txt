1.The Syntax to declare varaible is "data_type varaible_name;"
2.No
3.Yes
4.No
5.To declare Variables
6.Yes
7.Yes
8.No
9.The Syntax to declare array is "data_type[] arrary_name{}"
10.
11.The steps to run java program are:
	Writing the code with main method
	Saving the code with filename.java
	The "javac file_name.java" is used to compile the .java file to .class
	The "java file_name" is used to run the code.
12.The javac is the command in the java called as compiler, and it is used to compile
	the .java file into .class and the location of javac is 
	"C:\Program Files\Java\Jdk1.8.0_261\Bin"
	The java is also the command use to execute the program and its location is
	"C:\Program Files\Java\Jdk1.8.0_261\Bin"
13.Used to load the class.
14.The ArrayIndexOutofBound Exception occurs when we have array indexes of 5.
	And we use array index 6 in the program.
	We have to provide correct array indexes in the program.
15.Java is high level object oriented programming language which deals with the real 
	world entities or things.
16.The JDK is "Java Development Kit" used to write or create the programs and it acts as platform.
	The JRE is "Java Runtime Environment" used to run the programs or execute of the programs.
	The JVM is "Java Virtual Machine" where the actual execution takes place.
17.API
18.No
19.The WORA "Write once run anywhere" nature of java is due to the ".class" file or "byte_code",
	The byte_code can be run anywhere using the JVM, so the byte_code makes the java platform independent.
20.Error
21.The JVM "Java Virtual Machine" where the actual execution takes place. The JVM needs only byte_code for  
	execution. So it makes the java platform Independent. And it can be installed on any machine
22.The class has two members Variables and Methods.
	The variable is instance of a class.
23.The Arguments are usually used to print the data or values.
	The types of arguments are Formal and Actual.
24.The formal arguments are used to print the data.
	The actual arguments are used to reference.
25.The Variable is the instance of a class. It can be declared and initialised under the class.
	The Syntax of varaible is "data_type varaible_name;"
26.The java stores the variables or the ref of the varaibles in Constant pool in the memory.
27.The assigning of data or value to the varaible known as variable initialization.
28.To store and access the data easily.
29.
30.The actual Execution takes place.
	The JVM is cloud.
	Can be installed on any machine.
31.
32.The WORA stands for "Write Once Run Anywhere"
33.The "--version" used to check the version of java.
35.The class is design or template under which the variables,objects,methods are defined.
	And the class is non-primitive data type.
36.Basically the object refers to real world entities or things. In java the object is instance
	of class or container to store the data.
37.The syntax for declaring class is "class class_name{}"
38.The syntax is "class_name.method_name();"
39.Constructor is the block of code used to create copy of instance.
